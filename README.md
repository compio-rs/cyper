An HTTP library based on [compio](https://github.com/compio-rs/compio) and [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper).

This project references code from [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest).

## Quick start

Add `compio` and `cyper` as dependency:

```
compio = { version = "0.16.0", features = ["macros"] }
cyper = "0.5.0"
```

Then we can start a simple HTTP request:

```rust
use cyper::Client;

#[compio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = Client::new();
    let response = client
        .get("https://www.example.com/")
        .unwrap()
        .send()
        .await
        .unwrap();
    println!("{}", response.text().await.unwrap());
}
```
